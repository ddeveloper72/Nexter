# Advanced CSS tutorial

  _from a Udemy tutorial presented by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)_

## Preface

In this tutorial, I'm looking for ways in which to improve and expand on my experience in front-end development.  I love the platforms that I've been working on before, namely Django and Angular along with all the backend services and deployment processes and I believe that the look and feel of these applications can be vastly improved by the better use of advanced CSS.  in this tutorial, the site I am building focuses on using CSS grids to build a beautifully responsive CSS design.
